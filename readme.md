# hi! i'm dan.

if you're here, you somehow found yourself on a random boring old github profile.
here's what i do:
 - graphic designer
 - discord bot developer
 - community manager @ wilbursoot
 - python dev (i guess?)
 
where can you find me? well, i'm glad you asked! i design [here](pixelflow.studio), make music (sometimes) [here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3HCdxPhQXMWHDZ0gY42rDW) and idk what else i do tbh.

see you around!
